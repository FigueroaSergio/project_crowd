I understand that it is hard to judge color on a computer screen.  But this picture is absolutely NOT EVEN REMOTELY correct.  The fabric color in the picture is a light-ish, lime-ish green.  I received a very dark, forest green.  There is no way that this is the fault of the computer display.  This is the WRONG photo for the listing.  I bought this fabric to make a Tinker Belle costume, and now it is too close to Halloween to order it from someplace else.  I will never buy from this seller again.  I suggest that you DO NOT BUY THIS LISTING!",Stretch Panne Velvet Green Fabric By The YD,The Fabric Exchange,Pair_A24LKR7WEPN4J1-B00CF4O6K4

They were also not as vividly colored as what the picture shows online. This can be seen with the whites not being white. They had a gray tinge to them. The pinks were also very dark and had blackened looks to them instead of the vivid pink and white shades shown on the photo. I would not buy this again. The only designs I liked was the mint colored one with gold hearts and the pink with gold dots. Those two designes are not enough for me to constitute paying the price.,"me &amp; my BIG ideas Washi Tape Tube, Peony Florals",Me & My Big Ideas,Pair_A2BI55OZ0CEFF4-B01BULDOKA

Overall the pattern instructions were easy to follow, but the bodice portion took a little while to figure out.  My daughter is very tiny - typically a size 0 - and I cut the fabric using the guidelines for a size 8.  Be careful to look at the measurements before cutting.  I could have finished the dress in one day, it was that easy.  This was a great value for the money and the dress cost a lot less to make than to purchase, and it fit her perfectly.  She got multiple compliments the first day she wore it.","Simplicity Pattern 1360 Misses' Maternity Knit Dress or Mini Dress, K5 (8-10-12-14-16)",Simplicity Patterns,Pair_A3QOYOFJ6KOGLA-B00K9BD5VG

There is a lot of 'ruled paper' on the back, so what you see on the front cover is it - but these would probably be best used as journaling cards with all the ruled paper designs on the back of the DSP sheets.

For making cards, I have started using 6x6 pads only now.  The design is sized much smaller so the scale of the design fits the size of the card.  And the cost is great.  If I buy 12x12 pads now, I'm careful to buy patterns that are solid across the whole sheet - I do not want to make cards with a scrapbooking DSP sheet.  I can do it, but I would rather have the consistent solid pattern across the whole sheet instead of having to cut the page up in a way to work around the lopsided/huge focal point on a scrapbooking page.","Simple Stories Paper Pad, 6 by 6-Inch, Vintage Bliss, 24 Per Package",Simple,Pair_A3NAS4ZUEOAN12-B00BJKIU02
