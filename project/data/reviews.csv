And in the kitchen, we keep TWO pairs -- one to cut up herbs and such with (those stay in the knife drawer), and one to open bags and cut off tags with (that pair stays in the junk drawer). I've even put the kitchen pair in the dishwasher several times (which I'm sure can't be recommended, but I do it anyway), and they're still sharp. The handles are comfortable, and the price is right -- I highly recommend buying multiple packages, as you'll find great uses for them everywhere!","Westcott Recycled 8-Inch Straight Scissor, 3 Pack (16453)",Westcott,Pair_A1VGY05VGMXLJ0-B00X3N66F4

If you get a chance, look at the book. `Then I searched Youtube and found reviews on this brush.  Heaven!

Along the shore, I sketched waves -- lines of varying thickness and curves -- rapidly beautifully.  Trees in a second.  The most beautiful awesome lines in varying weights.

Anyone who draws needs this pen.  It is also great for calligraphy.
